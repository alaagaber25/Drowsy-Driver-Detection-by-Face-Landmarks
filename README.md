# Drowsy-Driver-Detection-by-Face-Landmarks
This project is a real-time Drowsiness Detection System using Python and OpenCV. It tracks eye movements through a webcam, calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), and triggers an alarm if drowsiness is detected. Ideal for driver safety and fatigue detection, it provides visual alerts and sound warnings to help prevent accidents.
